It's about my recent trip to Norway, some of the same footage as my previous video but this one explains a little about why I go away once a year to film something tricky.<br />

Thanks to Kessler for making the Pocket Dolly, electraDRIVE motor and Oracle controller for the timelapse dolly shots. Canon for making the 5D mark 3, great for landscape low light work. Panasonic for making the GH2 with it's lovely video quality in such a small camera and for being discrete enough to photograph out the plane window really easily. Final thanks to Tom Lowe at Dreamcore for Timescapes which inspired me to get out there and get some good timelapses.";s:3:"url";s:25:"http://vimeo.com/60835364";s:11:"upload_date";s:19:"2013-03-01 09:59:19";s:10:"mobile_url";s:27:"http://vimeo.com/m/60835364";s:15:"thumbnail_small";s:50:"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/422/429/422429208_100.jpg";s:16:"thumbnail_medium";s:50:"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/422/429/422429208_200.jpg";s:15:"thumbnail_large";s:50:"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/422/429/422429208_640.jpg";s:7:"user_id";i:6278932;s:9:"user_name";s:7:"TobyLoc";s:8:"user_url";s:21:"http://vimeo.com/tloc";s:19:"user_portrait_small";s:47:"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/189/994/1899940_30.jpg";s:20:"user_portrait_medium";s:47:"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/189/994/1899940_75.jpg";s:19:"user_portrait_large";s:48:"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/189/994/1899940_100.jpg";s:18:"user_portrait_huge";s:48:"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/189/994/1899940_300.jpg";s:21:"stats_number_of_likes";i:2261;s:21:"stats_number_of_plays";i:54965;s:24:"stats_number_of_comments";i:126;s:8:"duration";i:162;s:5:"width";i:1920;s:6:"height";i:1080;s:4:"tags";s:97:"northern lights, norway, timelapse, tromso, aurora borealis, motion control, documentary, tobyloc";s:13:"embed_privacy";s:8:"anywhere";}}
